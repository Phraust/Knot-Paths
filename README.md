# Knot-Paths

I had a hard time finding the actual knot path for tying an epaulette so I figured it out and sketched it up.  If I make any more of these, I'l add them here.

= Epaulette Path =

Use this path to make multiple-strand epaulettes (both left and right-handed). Three to four strands work well with 1/4" twisted line. I hide the beginning and end under the second middle crossing from the bottom.
