# Knot-Paths

I had a hard time finding the basic knot for tying an epaulette so I figured it out and sketched it up.  If I make any more of these, I'l add them here.

==================   Use this path to make multiple-strand epaulets (both left and right-handed).
= Epaulette Path =   Three to four work well with a thinner (1/4") twisted line.  
==================   I hide the beginning and end under the second middle crossing.
